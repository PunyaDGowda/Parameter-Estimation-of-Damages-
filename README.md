# Parameter-Estimation-of-Damages-
PINNs leverages the governing physical laws that dictate the behavior of time-dependent systems to act as a regularization agent. Parametric PINNs are used to identify
and characterize damage parameters within the structural domain. Ultrasonic imaging with a two-dimensional wave equation for isotropic material is used for simplicity. The stationary ultrasound excitation source is modelled with a five-cycle Hanning window sinusoidal burst which is applied at the center of the plate. The damage parameters are modelled using Gaussian function with critical parameters such as location, size and extent of damage which are to be detected. For simplicity,
only the damage location is parameterized, while damage size and magnitude is kept fixed. The underlying physics governing the behavior of the damage model is
encoded into the loss function in the form of damage equation, complemented by the inclusion of boundary and initial loss terms.
